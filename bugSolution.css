The solution involves adding a `background-repeat` property to cover all scenarios and verify the image exists and is accessible. It also employs the following to mitigate issues:

1. **Adding `background-repeat: no-repeat;`:** This helps ensure that if the image doesn't load fully or partially, you see at least the default background color, rather than a potential partial or repeating display of a corrupt image.
2. **Confirming Image Path:** Verify that the image file exists at the specified path and is accessible by the browser.
3. **Checking for CORS Issues:** Check that CORS headers are set up correctly on the server if your image is on a different domain than the CSS file.
4. **Testing Across Browsers:** Test thoroughly across a range of browsers and systems to identify the exact circumstances causing the issue.

```css
.element {
  background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Added for robustness */
}
```
By using `background-repeat: no-repeat;` it prevents unexpected behavior from partial or corrupted images.  The image is still verified to exist and potential CORS issues are checked during debugging.
