# Uncommon CSS Background Image Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue where a CSS background-image fails to load in certain environments while working correctly in others. The image path is validated, yet the background image remains absent.  The problem appears to be browser/system-specific rather than a simple path error.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  `bugSolution.css` offers a potential fix and explanation.

## Possible Causes and Solutions

The solution explores potential causes such as:

* **Caching:**  Aggressive browser caching might be serving an outdated or corrupted version of the image.
* **CORS Issues:** If the image is hosted on a different domain, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers may be misconfigured.
* **Image Format Incompatibility:** While less likely, the image format could be unsupported by a specific browser version.
* **Browser Extensions:** Browser extensions that interfere with image loading could be the culprit.

The solution attempts to address these issues via various strategies and explanations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (you'll need to create this file and link to bug.css or bugSolution.css).
3. Observe that the background image may or may not appear depending on your browser and system.
